This repository contains the source code for [welfley.me](https://welfley.me/) (Thomas Welfley's portfolio).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and, as such, has all of the typical create-react-app scripts configured: `npm start`, `npm test`, etc.
