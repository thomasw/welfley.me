I build engineering organizations and amazing software. From Python and JS microservices to SPAs and React Native mobile apps, I have extensive experience shipping software across all parts of the stack. Further, I can define and implement the hiring and management strategies required to scale. From inception to production, either as part of a team or independently, I make software happen. Just say the word and let's start building.
